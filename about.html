        <h1>Hi.<br>
        My name is kybronie</h1>
        <p id="mainp">As a graphic designer, my main purpose is to transform everyday projects into something unique, influencing others to look at a product or design from a fresh, unique perspective. I especially love and am inspired by branding, marketing, and print design. I enjoy working with other creative individuals as a team to help solve problems. Through my unique, interactive approach to design, I hope to reflect my driven, hard-working personality to those who see my work. 

            ​
            
            In my spare time, I am a wannabe-world traveler, 
            
            amateur-foodie, who enjoys live music, hotdogs, and cheesy 80s movies.</p>
